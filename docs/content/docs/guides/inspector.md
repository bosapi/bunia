title: Inspector
description: Alt+click any element in your dev page to jump to its source — or hand off to an AI agent.
---

The inspector plugin turns every rendered element into a link to its source. Hold **Option** (Alt) to highlight elements; click one to open its `.svelte` file at the exact line in your editor. Optionally, configure an AI endpoint to send a short comment alongside the location for automated code-fixing handoff.

It's a first-party plugin — no install. Works through compile-time attribute injection: every regular HTML element in your `.svelte` files is annotated with `data-bosia-loc="path:line:col"` during the dev build. Production builds inject nothing and mount no endpoint.

## Setup

Add `inspector()` to your `bosia.config.ts`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "bosia";
import { inspector } from "bosia/plugins/inspector";

export default defineConfig({
	plugins: [inspector()],
});
```

Run `bun run dev` and you're done. Defaults: editor `code`, no AI endpoint.

## Usage

- **Option + hover** — outline + tooltip showing `file:line`
- **Option + click** — open the source location in your editor (or open the AI form, if `aiEndpoint` is set)
- **Esc** — dismiss the AI form

## Options

```ts
inspector({
	editor: "cursor", // "code" | "cursor" | "zed" | any CLI
	aiEndpoint: "http://localhost:9999/fix", // optional — POST handoff
	endpoint: "/__bosia/locate", // overlay → server endpoint (default)
});
```

### `editor`

CLI command used to open the file. Defaults to `code` (VS Code). Built-in support for `cursor` and `zed`. Any other editor that takes `<command> -g file:line:col` (or `<command> file:line:col` for zed-like CLIs) works — the plugin handles the argv shape automatically for the three known editors.

For VS Code: install the "Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH" command from the Command Palette so `code` resolves on `$PATH`.

### `aiEndpoint`

When set, Option+click opens an anchored form (textarea + Send/Cancel) instead of jumping to the editor. On submit, the overlay POSTs to your AI endpoint:

```json
{
	"file": "src/routes/+page.svelte",
	"line": 42,
	"col": 5,
	"comment": "this button should be disabled when loading"
}
```

If the user submits an empty comment, the request falls back to opening the editor — handy for "I just want to jump there" without changing modes.

The plugin makes no assumption about the AI service; you implement the endpoint. Typical setup: a local script that takes the payload, runs your preferred coding agent against the file, and applies a patch.

## How It Works

1. **Compile-time injection.** The plugin contributes a Bun build plugin that runs before `SveltePlugin()`. For each `.svelte` file, it parses the source with `svelte/compiler`'s `parse()`, walks `RegularElement` nodes, and uses `magic-string` to insert a `data-bosia-loc` attribute right after each tag name. Source maps are preserved so error stack traces in dev still point at the right line.

2. **Skipped tags.** Capitalized component tags (`<MyButton>`), `<svelte:*>` special elements, and `<script>` / `<style>` blocks are skipped. Vite-style: clicking a `<button>` rendered inside a `<MyButton>` opens `MyButton.svelte` at the button's line, not the parent.

3. **Runtime overlay.** A small script is injected via `render.bodyEnd`. It listens for Alt-down + mousemove to draw the highlight, and Alt+click to trigger the action. The script reads `window.__BOSIA_INSPECTOR__` for config — no inline secrets.

4. **Server endpoint.** The plugin mounts `POST /__bosia/locate` via `backend.before`. With no comment, it spawns the editor command and returns. With a comment + `aiEndpoint`, it forwards the payload to your endpoint.

## Production

The plugin no-ops when `NODE_ENV !== "development"`:

- No attributes injected into the build output
- No overlay script in HTML
- No `/__bosia/locate` endpoint mounted

Verify with `bun run build && grep -r "data-bosia-loc" dist/` — should print nothing.
